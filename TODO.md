## Features

1. Personas: Allow additional assistant personas (defined by the user) to check each other's output.
2.

## Improvements

1. Pass ignore files to glob.
2. Intelligent file inclusions based on the query.
3. Automatic context squashing to optimize token counts (remove thinking, have user modifications directly overwrite tool uses).
4. Even more intelligent re-prompt agent - capture conversation from the current ask, not the last user text message (which could be clarification).
5. Expand the write_tool and edit_tool responses to say that the context has been updated.
6.
