## Features

1. Personas: Allow additional assistant personas (defined by the user) to check each other's output.
2.

## Improvements

1. Pass ignore files to glob.
2. Intelligent file inclusions based on the query.
3. Automatic context squashing to optimize token counts (remove thinking, have user modifications directly overwrite tool uses).
4. Expand the write_tool and edit_tool responses to say that the context has been updated.
5. Need a way to cancel "choice" while in diff/edit view
6. Ways to organize multiple file edits at once (build off of stash functionality)
7.
